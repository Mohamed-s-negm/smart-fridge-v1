# smart-fridge-v1
This project is around dealing with sensors that can be used in fridge to add more functionalities.

I have added a file, generate_dataset.py to generate the dataset used to train the ml models. I have also added the dataset that is used.

I have added the ml_model.py which has the code for making ml models.

I have also added the generate_ml_models.py to generate the ml models needed in the project. I have also stored the generated ml models into a file.

NOTICE: There is a tag v1.0.1 which has an ml model which is made using RandomForest and so the should be downloaded and store along with the other ml models.

Now, the ml models are ready and now we head into the dl model that we need.

The food-101-dataset had to be reshaped so, I created the reshape-food-101.py file to do the job.

I have finished the dl image classification class model which is in dl_model.py. This file now can be used to create any image classification model.
